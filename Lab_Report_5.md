## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario





## Part 2 - Reflection

In the second half of the quarter, the thing I would say I appreciated learning the most was learning how to use jdb. Using jdb makes seeing what my program is actually doing step by step. There is only so many test cases you can think of so I think just being able to see what is actually happening is very beneficial. The ability to also see what the exact values of the loal fields in our code is extremely useful and is something I will most defintely be using in the future.

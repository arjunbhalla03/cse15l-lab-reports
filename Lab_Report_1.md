*cd on its own*
1. The working directory was the directory lecture1.
2. When cd is called on its own, it will backtrack to the directory that the current directory is in. For us, that results in us leaving the lecture1 directory and going back to the main desktop.
3. There isn't an error as it does go back and send us to the previous as it is supposed to.

*with directory as its argument*
1. The working directory was the main desktop in edstem that is being used for the lab.
2. When cd is called with a directory as its argument, it will jump into it and set it as the new directory that we are operating inside of. Due to this, when we call cd lecture1, it jumps into the lecture1 directory.
3. There is no error as the command is completed perfectly and does what we expect it to do.

*with a path to a file as an argument*
1. The working directory was the main desktop in edstem that is being used for the lab.
2. When cd is called trying to jump into a specific file, it gets confused as it is a command used solely for getting into directories and therefore returns the statement saying it is not a directory.
3. yes, this is an error as cd is a command used solely for the purpose of entering directories and throws the error as it cannot enter files.
